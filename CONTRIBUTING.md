# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Wordlus. Contributions are welcome.

## What's Welcome

- Bug fixes and small improvements
- Accessibility and usability enhancements
- Performance or readability improvements
- Suggestions for new features (via issues or discussion)
- Word list suggestions with context or sources

## Word List Contributions

Because Wordlus is a language focused game:

- Word suggestions should be commonly recognizable
- Dialect differences should be noted where applicable
- No single dialect is treated as "more correct" than another

Final decisions on word inclusion are made to preserve:

- fairness
- playability
- learning value

## What to Expect

- Not all suggestions will be accepted
- Feedback will be handled respectfully
- Discussions should remain constructive and inclusive

## What's Out of Scope

- Major architectural rewrites without discussion
- Changes that increase complexity without clear benefit
- Arguments about linguistic authority or "correctness"

Wordlus exists to celebrate the Hmong language through play.
Please help keep it welcoming for everyone.
