# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: February 2026_

Wordlus is a free, open-source word game created to support learning and preserving the Hmong language. Your privacy matters, and this app is designed to collect as little information as possible.

## What Wordlus Does Not Collect

Wordlus does not:

- require an account
- collect names, emails, or personal details
- store guesses you type into the game
- track individual users
- use ads or third-party trackers for advertising
- sell or share data with third parties

## Analytics

Wordlus uses anonymous analytics to understand general usage and improve the app.

Examples of what may be measured:

- how many games are played
- whether players choose 4-letter or 5-letter modes
- which dialects are selected (White or Green)
- whether games are completed

Analytics are aggregated and not linked to individuals. No typed words, guesses, or personal identifiers are tracked.

## Cookies

Wordlus does not use cookies for advertising, personalization, or tracking individuals.

If analytics cookies are used, they are strictly for anonymous usage statistics and do not identify individual users.

## Third-Party Services

Wordlus may use a privacy-focused analytics provider (such as Google Analytics configured for anonymized data, or a similar service) solely to understand overall app usage.

These services are used only to help improve Wordlus and are not used for marketing or profiling.

## Open Source Transparency

Wordlus is open source. The source code is publicly available, and anyone is welcome to review how the app works and how data is handled.

## Children's Privacy

Wordlus does not knowingly collect personal information from children. Because no accounts or personal data are required, the app is safe to use for learning at any age.

## Changes to This Policy

This privacy policy may be updated occasionally to reflect improvements or changes to the app. Any updates will be posted on this page.

## Contact

If you have questions or concerns about privacy or data usage, you can reach out through the [Wordlus GitHub repository](https://github.com/Cultivate-Dev/wordlus).
